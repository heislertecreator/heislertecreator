heislertecreator/heislertecreator is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

All my code is my own, sourced, in part from articles referenced within the code, where applicable, regardless of the source. Note however, that the "starters", in those cases, are fundamentally changed, where necessary, to arrive at a, hopefully, correct, working product. You are free to change what you must for your software. You might try to construe that as a license, but it doesn't really matter in 70 years. I would not work against you.

tecreations-0.4.0.jar

New Changes...
CaptureTool integrated into current version. Long awaited.
Magnifier works across the CaptureTool. Still not shrinking, but for most use cases, this should not be an issue.
TextBlock, TextPoints, and Font re-written and re-integrated. Fonts are now created in <user.docs>/tecreations/fonts/.
Have inserted, but not acted upon, global.Artifacts. I suspect, there should be a management system above it for projects and the like. (test,dev,prod) with varying access levels, given the scope and nature of the Internet, digital nomads, hackers, bad actors and the like. 

You may have or want something like a global resource for factual information, social media, education facilities, resources worldwide, etc.
Probably security should be hardened, since we are living in wartime?

People should be educated in the use of technology so they can sort their problems. Preferably, once, and for all. No invasion of privacy, no data leakage. AI for all.

This project <b>loosely</b> conforms to the project produced by Krish in the video for Microservices In & Out [006] on YouTube via:

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqV7Z7FX3q0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqV7Z7FX3q0</a>
, yet, so far, is <b>100% pure Java ('96)</b> compliant, as far as I am aware. This should not be taken as a guarantee for liability. Use my software at your own risk. Please review the code, in order, that you may fully assess its' capabilities and vulnerabilities. I'm not sure any code is 100% safe.

This video also produces my artifacts, <a href="https://github.com/heislertecreator/spring-cloud-config">spring-cloud-config</a> and <a href="https://github.com/heislertecreator/spring-cloud-config-server">spring-cloud-config-server</a>

My working projects, so far, are on tecreations.ca, in this: <a href="https://tecreations.ca/java/downloads/release/">https://tecreations.ca/java/downloads/release/<a> directory space, or subtree, whichever you prefer.

  The tec.xml files are used with: <a href="https://tecreations.ca/java/downloads/release/DependencyViewer.jar">DependencyViewer.jar</a>. Please read the "<a href='https://tecreations.ca/ca/tecreations/documentation/java/tecreationsPKG.php'>Documentation</a>".
