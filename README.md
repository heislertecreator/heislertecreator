# spring-cloud-config-consumer
This project <b>loosely</b> conforms to the project produced by Krish in the video for Microservices In & Out [006] on YouTube via:

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqV7Z7FX3q0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqV7Z7FX3q0</a>
, yet, so far, is <b>100% pure Java</b> compliant.
This video also produces my artifacts, <a href="https://github.com/heislertecreator/spring-cloud-config">spring-cloud-config</a> and <a href="https://github.com/heislertecreator/spring-cloud-config-server">spring-cloud-config-server</a>

My working projects, so far, are on tecreations.ca, in this: <a href="https://tecreations.ca/java/downloads/release/">https://tecreations.ca/java/downloads/release/<a> directory space, or subtree, whichever you prefer.

  The tec.xml files are used with: <a href="https://tecreations.ca/java/downloads/release/DependencyViewer.jar">DependencyViewer.jar</a>. Please read the "<a href='https://tecreations.ca/ca/tecreations/documentation/'>Documentation</a>".
